Key Features of the Project

Data Preprocessing:
- Cleaning and handling missing values.
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting months, lead times, customer types).
- Standardization and encoding of categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Bar plots for booking counts and cancellation rates.
- Boxplots for special requests vs. cancellations.
- Heatmaps for correlation matrices.
- Stacked bar charts for trends by hotel type.
- Insights into booking trends, cancellation patterns, and customer behavior.

Machine Learning Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for model optimization.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and AUC scores.

Use Cases:
Insights for hotel management: Optimize staffing and resources during peak periods.
Customer segmentation: Improve marketing strategies by identifying high-value customer segments.
